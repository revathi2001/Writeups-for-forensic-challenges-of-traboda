You can't see me

We have received an image but seems like somebody has messed up with the data. Can you help us?

Using the tool pngcheck we can find errors in the file.Using ghex we can fix the following chunks as given hexdecimal values.

IHDR - 49 48 44 52
IDAT - 49 44 41 54
IEND - 49 45 4E 44
gAMA - 67 41 4D 41
